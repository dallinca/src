# Linking up to the Repo in Eclipse
1) Create a new workspace
2) Make a new java Project called "Catan" or really whatever you want
3) Use the terminal to delete the src file in the project you just made
4) Clone this repo where you deleted the old src folder
5) Now to use the repo you just need to go inside the src folder and use all the normal git commands

Cheers

#src
